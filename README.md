The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Features

- Processes and analyzes the acquired weather data
- Displays user-added recommended clothing items
- Offers a user-friendly interface for seamless navigation

## Technologies Used

- CSS for styling
- API Integration for fetching weather data
- Figma for design
